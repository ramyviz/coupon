Starting with the initial analysis of Customer Coupon data and drilling down details on the groups that have Higher Acceptance ratio of the coupons.

Observations
1) Overall Coupon Accepted Count and Rate is Higher than the Rejected metrics - The Marketing Coupon Campaign has been a success so far
2) Coffee Coupon Was the most offered and most accepted coupons were of Carry outs and Restaurants < 20 ones
3)Comparing the Acceptance ratio amound different groups - The Groups which had customers visit the Bar less than 3 times performed well in accepting the coupons, probably they wait for coupons or discounts for their trips to Bar.  Also Group age between 25 and 30 were performing less in accepting the coupons we can reduce the frequency in sending the coupons to that age group.
4) Analysis and observation from analysis the Coffee Coupons accpted by customers and their behavior conveys that most of the coupons are Accepted by Customer who are driving Alone, the next highest being when traveling with Friends.  

Next steps we can also see do more analysis if the Customers who visit less than 3 times have lower acceptance rate and other factors.  Our intention is finding the groups which we can reduce/increase in sending the coupons to those customers based on their behavior and attributes avaialble in the dataset.
